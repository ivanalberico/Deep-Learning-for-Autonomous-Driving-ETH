## Project 1: Understanding Multimodal Driving Data
Visualize the outputs of common autonomous driving tasks such as 3D object detection and point cloud semantic segmentation given a LiDAR point cloud, corresponding RGB camera image, ground truth semantic labels and network bounding box predictions.  
  
Moreover, identify each laser ID from the point cloud directly, and deal with the point cloud distortion caused by the vehicle motion with the aid of GPS/IMU data.

## Project 2: Multi-task learning for semantics and depth
Build Multi-Task Learning (MTL) architectures for dense prediction tasks, i.e. semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, exploiting joint architectures, branched architectures, and task distillation.  
  
Finally, improve the network with personal ideas or refer to existing papers to enhance the predictions.

## Project 3: 3D Object Detection from Lidar Point Clouds

Build a 2-stage 3D object detector to detect vehicles in autonomous driving scenes, i.e. to draw 3D bounding boxes around each vehicle. 
Unlike Project 2 which was based on 2D images, now irregular 3D point cloud data are exploited to detect vehicles.

The first stage, which is often referred to as the Region Proposal Network (RPN), is used to create coarse detection results from the irregular point cloud data. These initial detections are later refined in the second stage network to generate the final predictions.
